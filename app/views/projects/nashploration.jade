      p.project-description
        | A local Nashville teacher came to 2014's Hack4Change
        | event with the idea for an application to help engage school children with
        | local history and social studies. I was lucky enough to be a part of the
        | original team that began the project over the hack-a-thon weekend. We landed
        | a first place prize at the end of that event with aspirations to make it
        | a tangible product that could be used for Nashville's public school system.
      p.project-description
        | In order to make this aspiration a reality, I, along
        | with three other students from NSS, completely rebuilt the application into
        | what you see now. Currently, we are working alongside the Nashville Civic
        | Brigade and the City of Nashville to open-source Nashploration and put it
        | into production.

      p.project-contribution-title
        | <b>Contribution:</b> I contributed to nearly every facet of this project, from
